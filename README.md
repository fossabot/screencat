Screencat
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jlindsey/screencat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jlindsey/screencat)
=========

Screenshot sharing tool using the excellent [Sendcat](https://sendcat.com/) service.

Requirements
------------

This tool requires at least Sendcat v0.0.10, or any later version with the `-j` flag
for JSON output.

Usage
-----

If you are on macOS and haven't fiddled with any of the default screenshot settings, Screencat should
Just Workâ„¢. You can place it on your `PATH` and run it with the defaults (or, eg. using a Launch Agent or
in a background `tmux`).

It has two configurable settings via CLI flags: the directory it watches, and the regex to match filesystem
events as screenshots. For example:

```bash
$ /usr/local/bin/screencat -w /tmp/screenshots -r "screenshot-file-.*\.jpg$"
```
